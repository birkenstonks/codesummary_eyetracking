# Code Summarization
### This repo contains the code for running, analyzing, and visualizing the code summarization project
The task has participants read snippets of Java code while their gaze is recorded using a Tobii eye-tracker. For half of the task, participants read pre-written summaries (human-written or AI-written), and for the other half, participants write their own summaries. It is randomized whether participants read or write summaries first. Java code comes from the FIXME dataset, and the AI summaries are generated by FIXME. 

## Running the Task
The main file for running the task is server2.py. It does not rely on any esoteric packages, other than perhaps tobii_research, so the setup should *hopefully* be straightforward. The task is randomized using each participant's ID number as a random seed, which ensures the order will be the same for each ID number. The task is designed so the participant gets a break in the middle of each section (reading or writing) and in the middle of the whole task. This was designed to give the participant a break, and give the researchers the opportunity to recalibrate the eye-tracker every 15-20 minutes. The task is also designed so if the internet cuts out or for some reason the task crashes, it will resume at the last save point. 
Below is a list of all the data types recorded during the task:

## Data 
</br> Keystrokes: All keystrokes made by participants, including timepoints and the function name. Saved as <idnum>_keystrokes.csv
</br> (e.g. 008,showLatestPlan,18418213,S,2023-02-21 16:57:42.880827)
</br>
</br> Task: All ratings on summary reading section and all summaries on writing section. Saved as <idnum>_task.csv
</br> (e.g. ID#,	createServerChooser, 35553791,	reading,		 ,creates the server chooser, callcon,	neutral,	s_agree,	s_disagree,	agree,	36:35.9) where columns are participant_id, function_name, function_id, task, participant_summary, given_summary, summary_author, how_accurate, missing_info, unnecessary_info, end_time. For the writing condition, the ratings columns will be empty and the participant's summary will be recorded.
</br>
</br> Reading Save: The participant's progress on the reading task (e.g. how many stimuli they've seen)
</br>
</br> Writing Save: The participant's progress on the writing task 
</br>
</br> Gaze folder: contains all the gaze files if eye-tracking is being recorded, split by file name.
